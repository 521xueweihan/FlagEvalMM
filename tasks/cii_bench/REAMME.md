# CII-Bench

CII-Bench (Chinese Image Implication Benchmark) is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess MLLMs' ability to understand deep implications in Chinese images.

Original project: https://cii-bench.github.io/

## Overview

CII-Bench comprises 698 images spanning six domains:
- Life (31%)
- Art (18%)
- Society (22%)
- Politics (3%)
- Environment (7%)
- Chinese Traditional Culture (19%)

## Description

CII-Bench is designed to evaluate the higher-order perception and understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Chinese images. The benchmark stands out through several key features:

1. **Authentic Chinese Context**: All images are sourced from the Chinese Internet and manually reviewed
2. **Quality Assurance**: Corresponding answers are manually crafted
3. **Cultural Depth**: Includes Chinese traditional paintings and cultural elements to assess deep cultural understanding

## Purpose

The benchmark aims to:
1. Fill the gap in evaluating MLLMs for higher-order perception of Chinese visual content
2. Enable MLLMs to better understand Chinese semantics and Chinese-specific images
3. Contribute to the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI)

## Framework Integration

This version has been modified to work within the flagevalmm framework.
